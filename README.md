# Air-france-search-engine-optimization
This group project serves as an analysis of international marketing campaigns by Air France in order to generate recommendations for effective search engine marketing. The project demonstrates the visual and statistical tools in R to import, study, visualize, and present the raw data in a method that is easy for any user to digest and understand.

First, the raw data in excel is loaded into a dataframe.

Second, the raw data is cleaned and organized. My team identify the missing data and developped a strategy for missing values and potential outliers. Additionally, we calculated new fields in R that are necessary for subsequent analysis, i.e. return on advertisement, revenue, cost of booking and booking probability. 

Third, the team used descriptive analysis to identify the most effect marketing channel and generate a publiser strategy. Specifically, we created pivot tables and charts to compare different SEM campaigns. Additionally, my team found the best keyword match type and advertisement bid strategies by publisher. In the keyword analysis, the team used word clouds and interestings visuals to clearly present the most effective keywords. 

Lastly, we shared our findings a 12 minute presentation in front of the masters of business analytics student body.

The dataset is sources from the case study on Air France International Marketing by Kellog School of Business. The external libraries used are readxl, dplyr, plotly, ggplot2, tidyverse, rJava, qdap, tm, wordcloud, plotrix, dendextend, ggthemes, and RWeka.
